2 Given two Stock prices, a and b, implement a function to plot a line which connects them in a line chart: main.55,31.11

# Analysis
Fibonacci numbers 'F(n)' follows a basic recursive property such as F(n) = F(n−1) + F(n−2), where F(0)=0 and F(1)=1. The interviewer expected me to write the program in Es6(we were not allowed to use a timer module), so I wrote a basic recursive function using (ES6) and it takes approximately 7ms to generate a list of Fibonacci numbers of length 10. But I was asked the reason of using recursion? I said, therefore recursion performance will be low due to multiple function calls and repeated values storage in the memory stack, I started using a dynamic approach memoization. But the problem with recursion is the number list is generated but we couldn't need to iterate over each to get length. So I transformed an array into an array iterator using a generator function.
In order to my implementation, I used the XOR trick (Exclusive OR) to separate curve geometry from render, so the pipeline was pure and clean.
The integrator is not on my forecast, I didn't expect that question, so I did get a retake and passing mainly because the first two were clean.

512,26.77904401498381,Write a Rust function that performs binary exponentiation.,"
-
The key ingredient of this is a recursive algorithm called binary exponentiation. Googling ""binary exponentiation"" will find you more information on it, but here is some pseudocode:
repeat x ← base + base (2. exponent + 1) 2. exponent ← exponent / 2 continue until exponent ≡ 0 do x ← (base + x) / 2 output x It needs two factors: the base b (the number to be raised to a power) and the exponent e. The output is b to the power of e.
Write a function that needs an argument of type f64 and returns an f64 that performs binary exponentiation, also known as Successive Squaring.
func(2.0f64, 3.0f64) //> 8.0
func(5.0f64, 11.0f64) //> 2275.0
fn binary_exp(b: f64, e: f64) -> f64 {
    let mut x: f64 = 0.0;
    let mut exponent: f64 = 1.0;
    loop {
        x = (b + b) / 2.0;
        exponent = exponent / 2.0;
        if exponent == 0.0 {
            break;
        }
    }

    x
}

This can be done shorther using a riddle:
fn binary_exp(b: f64, e: f64) -> f64 {
    repeat (base + base) / 2;
    drop base *= base / 2;
    base /= 2 while base;
    base + base / 2
}

512,26.920031531946734,How do I allocate memory in C?,"
I'm coming to C design patterns after some time writing Emacs Lisp.  I've glanced through Design Patterns in C to get a sense of their scope but am now stuck about creating these patterns in my code.

Specifically, I'm creating a command interpreter and want to make an extensible dictionary command.  I'd like to instantiate different dictionary implementations based on the string argument of a command.  In other words, if implementation goat is specified, the command function will return gan instance of goat.
Instantiating the dictionary structures from command_execute() - a bit like a procedural factory is the problem I'm having now.
Even inside the command_execute function, the parameters (and the other implementations are pigs, sheep and antelopes - they aren't real dictionary implementations; is this meaningful or should I post the full code?).
How do I create an extensible dictionary manager (that can create any type of dictionary implementation) and iterate through a list: {goat=Gen, pig=G, hog=Ho, hump=Fun with extra arguments}?  If I understand the question, is my current approach correct or do I need an initial header file, allocation list etc. to get this to work?
Add questions tagged homework to homework questions. See the homework policy for guidelines on asking appropriate questions.

A: Er... yes. What *are* you talking about? Are you asking about a ""command language""? This sounds a lot like the old-style ""compiled languages"" that Lisp (from its days as Automatic LISP) used to compile. A (compiled) Lisp function is a symbol and a list; the first element of the list is the Implementation-of-this-Function, and the rest of the list is the parameter list. The symbol is the name given to the function.
Anyway, back to the question. you write ""Instantiating the dictionary structures from command_execute() - a bit like a procedural factory""
In the first place, if there's a datastructure, it's not Procedural. Procedural means you have a command that returns its result in a Value; a statement that changes it is *not* Procedural. Data structures don't do either of those things.

Tom & Carol,
Ignoring the canard that christianity is at the root of the fall of the Roman empire, this post will address the multitudinous reasons for the eventual fall that took several centuries to come to fruition. Out of order, but relevant in my opinion are the Plague of Justinian that lasted for more than twenty five years and killed nearly 300-350 million people in total -- and the Jews. The Jews became prominent in the empire especially after the improved relations between the empire and the Hebrew nation under Vespasian’s reign. Of course, remember, this fall did not come at one time, and it has been a struggle to locate the commencement of the fall with some even setting the date of Constantine’s establishment of the empire as christian nearly two hundred years before his rule. Curiously, Constantine was later ranked as a saint even though he was not ‘baptized’ until he was on his deathbed (typical christian belief that that will get you there -- baptism even in death!) Why, even Gibbon today in his “Decline and Fall...” points out that “Constantine had no deep privately held religious faith” (Gibbon, ""1""). Even Grayling went to great pains to point out that christians were prevalent, “men rebelling against pagan orthodoxy long before an official religion was established” (Grayling, ""1""). Christians, as we have earlier discussed, were persecuted, but that wasn't because they were christians, but rather it had more to do with the demand from the church that their followers put their religion ahead of the government, ahead of slavery, fomented rebellion -- and of course their sexual repression that was never enjoyed. People in the Roman empire enjoyed sex almost overly so! But, lets examine a few more reasons for the fall. Disease was an obvious factor, as you know, and was responsible for the death of about a third of the empire’s population (Gibbon, ""1). The military rule in ‘imperial’ Rome was also a primary factor (Gibbon, ""1""). In addition (and perhaps the most damning), the ever",mixtral-autogptq

(1) Changes in EconomyThe dissemination by print of commerce statutes and regulations by states helped to expand and transform the nature of the market economy that developed into capitalism. The Bible and tracts preached the virtues of hard work and saving.
(2) Rapid Dissemination of IdeasThe more educated people who now became able to read could be persuaded to take a particular point of view. Scientific books popularized new findings and created demands for new machines and goods.
(3) Standardized LanguagesBibles printed in vernacular promised a standardized form of language and dialect that would be universally understood, serving to unify a state. The invention of dictionaries also served as a unifying force by identifying acceprd spellings for vernacular lexicons.
(4) Public SphereDissemination of ideas and information through books and periodicals created a “marketplace of ideas” that existed outside government control where people could discuss and debate public opinion.
(5) New OccupationsPrinting’s dissemination of new ideas and literacy created new professional and personal occupations such as journalists, scientists, and novelists, artists, thespians, and musicians. In the latter part of the sixteenth century, newspapers became primary sources of information for everyone. During the Enlightenment philosophes used the power of the printed word to enlighten Europe.

512,27.255641828058288,What are the effects of quantitative easing?," An empirical review

This paper asks what the effects of quantitative easing were on a wide range of macroeconomic outcomes such as output, inflation, unemployment, and key asset prices. It does so by presenting a meta-analysis methodology capable of consolidating results from multiple macroeconomic models as well as addressing the issue of time heterogeneity. Results are obtained for countries that applied the monetary intervention brightly and systematically, namely the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom. The main conclusion is that the effect of quantitative easing and its central channel, namely the accommodation of a term premium, are very small and inconsistent depending on time and country. Other channels of action of monetary policy, either monetary or non-monetary, may be more important.Highlighted resultsDealing with macroeconomic models that have been estimated repeatedly too often conveys a confusing outcome because the average effect of the variables is computed moving the sample boundaries. No wonder why economists could hardly find an agreement on the large questions at hand. Meta-analysis, a branch of statistics developed to handle this type of problems, aims to be the tool that is necessary here, capable of providing answers despite quantitative technical innovation blossoming in quantitative economics.The innovation in this paper resides in its instrumental application to the specific issue of quantitative easing (QE), which enables us to face the impact of such policy without neglecting classical macro models. Such a model, therefore, synthesizes evidences from estimates of different models, including a Markov-switching model and dating the recession time of the BoF said to be quite important in transmission channels. Hence it is used also for evaluating the impact of QE by hysteretic business contractions.Lastly, by summarizing a big set of outcomes in a third grade of meta-analysis (""metacalculation"", so to say), coordinated by Alesina (2018), we approach a lovely coherence (""rigorous like the mathematical induction""?) in measuring the average impact of QE on all targeting variables, and not them alone.

Such representations of a 'Cynocephalus Celtus' are well-known in Europe from at least the 12th century CE onwards. Painted depictions of Christ, Mary, saints and/or the chivalric Knights Templar being guided by a 'Cynocephalus Celtus' survive in northern Europe and are so widespread as to be documented in Spiers' and Van Der Lingen's recent survey of anthropomorphic animal imagery. A figure of Christ flanked by a 'Cynocephalus Celtus' is the most common dog-headed example. While many anthropomorphic presentations have been.

Faceless Nun
Responsible (if that's the word) for many more sightings than are listed here is the so-called ""faceless nun"". We can reveal no images of the phenomenon, since it was too dark for a photograph.
