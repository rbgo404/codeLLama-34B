454,50.64525916194543,Implement a Python function to compute the Fibonacci numbers.,"Implement a Python function to compute the Fibonacci numbers.

The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence (called the Fibonacci sequence), defined recursively as:

```
Fib(0) = 0
Fib(1) = 1
Fib(N) = Fib(N - 1) + Fib(N - 2), for N > 1.
```

Given N, return the Nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.

Example 1:

```
Input: 2
Output: 1
Explanation: Fib(2) = Fib(1) + Fib(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Fib(3) = Fib(2) + Fib(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: 4
Output: 3
Explanation: Fib(4) = Fib(3) + Fib(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
```

Example 4:

```
Input: 5
Output: 5
Explanation: Fib(5) = Fib(4) + Fib(3) = 3 + 2 = 5.
```

Note:

0 <= N <= 30

## Solution

```
class Solution:
    def fib(self, N: int) -> int:
        if N == 0:
            return 0
        if N == 1:
            return 1
        return self.fib(N - 1) + self.fib(N - 2)

512,53.997746162931435,Write a Rust function that performs binary exponentiation.,"Write a Rust function that performs binary exponentiation.

Binary exponentiation is a method of computing the power of a number. It is a fast and efficient way to calculate large powers of a number.

The function should take two arguments: the base number and the exponent. It should return the result of the base raised to the power of the exponent.

The function should use a recursive approach to calculate the power. The base case of the recursion should be when the exponent is 0, in which case the result should be 1.

The function should also handle negative exponents by taking the absolute value of the exponent and then calculating the power.

The function should be able to handle large numbers and exponents.

The function should be written in Rust and should be efficient and optimized for performance.

The function should be tested with a variety of inputs to ensure that it is working correctly.

The function should be documented with comments explaining how it works and how to use it.

The function should be named `binary_exponentiation` and should be exported as a public function.

Zombie stars are a type of star that has been reanimated after its death. They are also known as white dwarfs, and they are the remnants of stars that have gone through a process of stellar evolution.

When a star runs out of fuel, it can no longer produce energy through nuclear fusion. This causes the star to collapse in on itself, and the outer layers of the star are blown off into space. The remaining core of the star is then compressed into a very dense object known as a white dwarf.

White dwarfs are incredibly hot and dense, with temperatures reaching millions of degrees and densities that are comparable to the density of an atomic nucleus. Despite their small size, white dwarfs are incredibly massive, with some having masses that are comparable to the mass of our Sun.

Despite their small size and high density, white dwarfs are still considered to be stars, as they emit light and heat. However, they are not considered to be ""living"" stars, as they are no longer producing energy through nuclear fusion.

The term ""zombie star"" is used to describe white dwarfs because they are the remnants of stars that have gone through a process of stellar evolution and have been reanimated in a sense. They are the final stage in the life cycle of a star, and they represent the end of a star's life.

In conclusion, zombie stars, also known as white dwarfs, are the remnants of stars that have gone through a process of stellar evolution and have been reanimated in a sense.
