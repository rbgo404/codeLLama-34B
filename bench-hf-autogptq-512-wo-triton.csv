For example,
Given [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18],
The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], therefore the length is 4. Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.

Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.

Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?

529,18.310924240999157,"Given a sequence of matrices, find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices.","Given a sequence of matrices, find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices.

For example, given the following sequence of matrices:

A = 10 x 30
B = 30 x 5
C = 5 x 60

D = 60 x 20

E = 20 x 30

F = 30 x 10

You should return the order of the elements (A, B, C, D, E, F) and the minimum number of operations needed to multiply the sequence.

In this case, we get the following:

(A * B) * (C * D) * (E * F)

The above can be rewritten as:

(10 * 30 * 5) * (5 * 60 * 20) * (20 * 30 * 10)

Which is equal to:

10 * 30 * 5 * 5 * 60 * 20 * 20 * 30 * 10

Which is equal to:

10 * 30 * 5 * 5 * 60 * 20 * 20 * 30 * 10

Which is equal to:

20000000

So the order of the sequence would be: (A, B, C, D, E, F)

And the minimum number of operations would be: 20000000

Note: You can assume the number of operations associated with multiplying a matrix with another matrix is equal to:

the number of rows in the first matrix multiplied by the number of columns in the second matrix multiplied by the number of columns in the first matrix

So in the above example, the number of operations required to multiply matrices A and B is:

10 * 30 * 5

Because:

10 is the number of rows in A
30 is the number of columns in A
5 is the number of columns in B
