A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

For example, ""tacocat"" is a palindrome, as are ""radar"", ""rotator"", and ""10000000000000000"".

Note:

A palindrome can be an empty string.
A palindrome does not need to be a single word.
A palindrome can have punctuation and symbol characters.

For example,
Given [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18],
The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], therefore the length is 4. Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.

Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.

Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?
