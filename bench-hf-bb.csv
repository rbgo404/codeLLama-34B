For example,
Given [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18],
The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], therefore the length is 4. Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.

Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.

Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?

For example, given the following sequence of matrices:

A B C D

The minimum number of multiplications are 7: (AB)C = ACB = A(BC) = (AB)CD = (AB)(CD) = (A(BC))D = (AC)(BD) = (AC)(BD)

Given an array of integers representing the dimensions of the matrices. Find the minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply the sequence of matrices.

Input Format

First line contains T, the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines.

The first line consists of a single integer N, the size of the sequence.

The second line consists of N space separated integers where the ith integer denotes the number",nf4 4bit quantization bitsandbytes
