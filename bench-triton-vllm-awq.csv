Example:

Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 
Note:

There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.

The problem is not actually to perform the multiplications, but merely to decide in which order to perform the multiplications.

For example, suppose you are given the following sequence of matrices:

A[1] A[2] A[3] A[4] A[5]

Suppose you want to compute the product A[1]A[2]A[3]A[4]A[5].

Notice that A[5]A[4]A[3]A[2]A[1] is not the most efficient way to compute the product.

### Example 1:
```
Input: [10, 20, 30]
Output: 6000
Explanation: 10 * 20 * 30 = 6000

```
Input: [1, 10, 2, 3]

### Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and M denoting the number of vertices and the number of edges respectively. The second line of each test case contains N space separated integers denoting the weight of each vertex. The third line of each test case contains three space separated integers u, v and k denoting the starting vertex, the destination vertex and the position of the edge in the graph respectively.

### Output

For each test case, print the shortest distance from the starting vertex to the destination vertex.

### Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100

1 ≤ N ≤ 1000

1 ≤ M ≤ 1000
