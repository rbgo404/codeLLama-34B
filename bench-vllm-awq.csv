Write a function that takes two parameters and returns their sum.,vLLM,327,8.67993149299582," If both parameters are numeric, it should return the sum. If either of the parameters are NAN, in any case, it should return NAN (double value) If any other type of the parameter comes, the function should return ""Value Type Mismatch"" as a string.

Note: Assume that status of the argument passed is taken care of by the compiler and the code should just handle the function logic.

The below code should be submitted for this problem (as a single file named as template.cc).
You can add additional lines of code to make the code better (performance or functionality wise) before the return statement of your function if you like to. Proper comments should be added as also required. Please include all necessary header files required in your submission.

Note : Please do not make any changes to the function declaration format

Sample Input
x = 1.22 , y=11 // numeric output
Sample Output
12.2
Sample Input
x = 122 , y=11 // valid inputs
Sample Output
Value Type Mismatch
Sample Input
x=122, y = 11 // 'Y' is lowercase
Sample Output
122
N.B: The expected solution should be able to handle all the inputs like NAN, NA1NAN, INF, -INF, +INF, -122, -122- INF/+INF. Handle all the possible inputs and return output as required.ingo shuyfast"

"Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.",vLLM,394,10.527155597999808,"
For example, Given [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18] ,
The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], therefore the length is 4. Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
Your algorithm should run in O(n^2) complexity.

Follow up:
Can you improve it to O(nlogn)?

"Given a sequence of matrices, find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices.",vLLM,188,5.011245308996877,"

The constraint is that the number of entries in the result will not be more than d2 .
Example : 

Given matrices A[ ] = {A1, A2, A3, A4, ... AN} and integer d , add, multiply and minimize  these matrices.
You are allowed to perform these operations in any order

m1(A1, A2) : multiply the matrix A1 with A2 to give a single matrix of dimension m X n
m2(A1, A2) : add the matrix A1 with A2 to give a single matrix of dimension m X n
Let OP be some optimal ordering of given sequence of matrices.

Matrix Chain Multiplication is an algorithm that should multiply given sequence of matrices in some order. The cost involved in this multiplication is minimum possible cost that is not more than d

Note : For Trees : If you know pre-order traversal then you can easily figure out 
inorder traversal.
And If we know the inorder traversal then we can easily construct the tree 
(For all data-structures and NOT for all structures. For some structures you 
cant construct the tree).
So here in this question we know the BST. Get the inorder traversal of the given 
bst and return k'th smallest element.

"Given a weighted graph and two vertices, find the shortest path between them using Dijkstra's algorithm.",vLLM,512,13.74407014100143,"


Given the numbered edges $E$, the starting and ending vertices, $s$ and $t$, and the set of vertex weights, $V$, of length $n$, compute the length of the shortest path $P$ between $s$ and $t$.

**Input Format**<br>
The first line contains two integers, $n$, the number of vertices, and $m$, the number of weighted edges.
The $m$ next lines each contain three space separated integers, $a$, denoting one end of an edge, $b$, denoting the other end, and $c$, denoting the edge weight.
The $n+1$th line contains two space separated integers, $s$ and $t$, the starting and ending vertices.

**Constraints**
- $1 \leq n,m \leq 100$
- $0 \leq E(i,j) \leq 1000$
- $0 \leq P \leq 2000$
- $0 \leq s,t \leq n-1$

**Output Format**
An integer that represents the entire cost of the shortest path. If $P$ does not exist, output a space.

**Sample Input**
```
4 4
0 1 3
0 3 5
1 2 1
2 3 2
1 3
```

**Sample Output**
```
4
```

**Explanation**

Vertex $0$ and $1$ share an edge of weight $3$. The weight of the edge from $0$ to $3$ is $5$, while the edge from $1$ to $3$ has weight $3$. The rest of the edges are of minimal weight. The connections are shown diagrammatically below:
