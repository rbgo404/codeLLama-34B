Write a function that takes two parameters and returns their sum.,vLLM,50,0.868831682997552," If one of the parameters is null then return 0.

Write a function to calculate the factorial of a given number.,vLLM,512,8.560421496000345,"
Factorial of a positive integer, is the multiplication of all the integers till the number.
Note: Factorials for negative numbers do not exist.
In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n represents the product of all positive integers from 1 to n. In terms of the gamma function, it is written as n! = Γ(n + 1).
The factorial of one or any positive integer is the simplest expression by using product notation for a multiple number of items.
For example 5! = 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 120.
Once the maximum value exceeds the environment-variable MAXINT, which is 268435455, the function will need a different formula to calculate the factorial.
5! = 120, but the sum of n! is 5! ÷ 3! and 3·2·1 (divided by the implied 3!).
This solution skips the multiplication of 1, which is the same as removing it from your function to begin with. That's a minor optimization.
the other way, you can keep the duplicates and get the same results with unique(). be aware that this has shenanigans riding on top of it that make it slower for really large arrays, and odd projects.
Other people's solutions will return 1 even when 0! is passed in. My solution returns 1 whenever n >= 0, and error message when n < 0.
works with negative values too.
Now I feel like I learned something about JavaScript. Not sure about all the downvotes, but I'll +1 for that note. Thanks!
""Always test your code with extremely large values""
""The factorial of zero is defined to be 1 by some definitions and conventions.""
so it got stuck in that state. Can't get it out.
You can also use zero factorial is 1 to speed up your maths.
Maybe there will be a flurry of edits upon the answers until the one that is the fastest is on the top?
I have not voted on nor commented about any of these answers per se, but rather to get the votes and to achieve community up votes.

For example,
Given [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18],
The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], 
therefore the length is 4. Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, 
it is only necessary for you to return the length.

Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.
