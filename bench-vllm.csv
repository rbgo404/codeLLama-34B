Write a function to calculate the factorial of a given number.,vLLM,290,13.721396842000104," 
The factorial of a number is the product of all the 
integers smaller than it.

For example, if we want to calculate the factorial of
number 3, then the result will be:

1 * 2 * 3 = 6

What are the different ways you can write to calculate the factorial
of a number?

Hint:
The fact that all of the numbers that you will use will be small integers (<= 10)
will significantly help your algorithm!

Write a function to determine if a given string is a palindrome.,vLLM,398,18.93546342600166," Character comparison should be case independent.

_Solution Idea:_

Using the string replace method to change all the uppercase string in the word to lowercase and lowercase to uppercase. Can we reverse compare these words.

const palindrome = require(""./palindrome"");

 describe(""isPalindrome"", () => {
   test(""function is defined"", () => {
    expect( typeof palindrome( ""amanda"" ) ).toBe(""boolean"");
  });
  
  test(""test upper and lower case"", () => {
    expect(palindrome(""A tree, a life, a bench"")).toEqual(true);
  });
  
  test(""should return boolean"", () => {
    expect(palindrome(""Show or choose"")).toEqual(false);
  });
  
  test(""should return boolean"", () => {
    expect(palindrome(""Madam, I’m Adam"")).toEqual(false);
  });
  
  test(""should return boolean. Empty string return true"", () => {
    expect(palindrome("""")).toEqual(true);
  });
  test(""test upper and lower case should return true"", () => {
    expect(palindrome(""Go hang a salami. I'm a lasagna hog. Wise sir, can you: No, it is not easy to find a trustworthy stapir on maps, but it is with you"")).toEqual(true);

  return str === _.toLower(str.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, """"));

"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print ""Fizz"" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print ""Buzz."" For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print ""FizzBuzz.""",vLLM,512,24.636730899001122,"
 *By using a StringBuffer, you can refactor FizzBuzz to print the results.

递归算法，该函数有一个case就是s为空串时返回0，一个emptyCheck函数用于检查如果布尔值为真如何处理，我们定义他为抛出异常。在这个函数中定义了一个嵌套的Sum私有类，并且用static私有的方法调用了文件，它会将每个字符串的第一个字母取出并将剩余的字母组成一个新的字符串。然后用他自递归调用CountString函数。
 * Physical Toll Booth Simulation Defines a program that simulates a toll booth. The customer has already decided not to drive though the conversion. The cashier at the toll booth first asks for the vehicle's license number. Then, the cashier checks the license plate data base and obtains the car's weight and the number of cents owed, records the number of cars using the computer (such as MS Access), and sends two cents out of every five to the county. prints a ticket number, the weight, and the toll (it is always two cents for a weight of less than 100 pounds).
The above code is run in debug and repair mode. The defects are fixed by applying the right fix. All the bug fixes occur in the “Fix Defects” module.
Overall description of the Software: The software is a car with counter which keeps count for the number of cars passing through a bridge at a particular Time. The software interrupts the vehicle when on the bridge and uses an Ultra sonic height sensor to calculate the height of a vehicle passing through the bridge, if height is less than or greater than 4 meters the software throws an Exception and shows “HIGHTHAN 4</HIETHAN 4″ exceptions.
The Weight API could also be viewed as an interface"

This example explains some basic tests for your implementation and also gives some ideas in algorithm design.

"Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.",vLLM,124,5.840645943997515,"

For example,
Given [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18],
The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], therefore the length is 4. Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.

Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.

Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n*log(n)) time complexity?"
