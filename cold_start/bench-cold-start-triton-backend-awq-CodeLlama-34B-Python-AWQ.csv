Triton Inference Server is an open-source model deployment system capable of serving models trained with popular machine learning and deep learning frameworks.
While this is similar to Triton server what is different?
vLab is built to be completely standalone, with no external dependencies and able to offer routing capabilities with encryption.
The vLab deep learning server is also based on Nvidia’s Triton and comes with a user interfave and a service of the cloud service Esse(we call esse).
Separate your model into inference and train phase, using different models and/or GPUs. Host machine can be used to upload data and/or to train model.
Inference phase uses a different model/method of the training phase.
Computing is used to host model for inference and to make this computation fast, without being a drain on the host machine you are training on. ML infrastructure is provisioned as a cloud service on the same physical machine that you need to use for training.
For every deployment vLab creates a modeling service (class) that the API communicates with.
Simply invoke the API with a payload of iteration number of corresponding data, and the machine’s answer will be served back.
You don’t have to worry on how, where and when to deploy while your hardware power is pumping to find best solution to your problem.
It is as easy as opening VSCode, writing code, hitting F5, selecting your method, clicking on the POST method and running it in any browser.
Ensure your hardware is propertly set up for accessing the ports and accesing locally from the your Linux computer physically connected to your GPU.
You can view the generated programs console from VSCode by hitting CTRL+ARROW_KEYS (by default VSCode will open the current active gcc version).
First make sure that you have the secret file of your deep learning server generated called _sercret_config.json file in /src/services/.
You can then use HTTPyac or HTTPeye to look at the Headers.
The return will be your vLab Service’s name.
An example of using HTTPys (generated) can be found here: https://github.com/vladushak/vlab-v1/blob/master/src/apps/webcmps/spielsliste_service.py.",triton-backend-awq
