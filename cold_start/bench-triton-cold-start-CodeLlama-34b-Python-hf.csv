2. Write a Python function to sum all the items in a list.
3. Write a Python function to multiplying the values in a dictionary.
4. Write a Python function to reverse a string.
5. Write a Python function to find the first appearance of the substring 'not' and 'poor' from a given string, if 'not' following the 'poor', rewrite the string to be 'good'. Return the new string.
Note: It is guaranteed that the first string argument given to this problem will be a copy of the third quote string. It looks like so: ""abcde"" -> ""cdea"".
6. Write a Python function to sort a list of nested dictionaries.
7. Write a Python function to remove key value pairs from a dictionary whose keys are numbers.
8. Write a Python function to count spaces at the beginning of a string.
9. Write a Python function that accepts a string and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.
10. Write a Python function that takes a list of words and returns the length of the longest one.
Example : [""cursor"", ""Google"", ""github"", ""fabric""]
11. Write a Python function to check whether a number is in a given range.
>> True, since the number 10 is in the range from 2 to 15.
12. Write a Python function to find the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.
>> maxList = [2, 3, 4, 5]
13. Write a Python function to print the number of prime numbers which are less than or equal to a given integer.
Code Sample:

14. Write a Python function to check whether every even index contains an even number and every odd index contains odd number of a list.
>> True
15. Write a Python function of SetStringCharacter(str, index, character) that takes in a string, a character, and an index of where the character should be inserted.
If the index is out of range, the string return the original string without that character.
>> Example :
set_string('python', 4, '$') -> 'pyt$hon'
set_string('python', 11, '$') -> 'python'
