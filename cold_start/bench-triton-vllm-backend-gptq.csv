Union and Intersection of Set

Please take a minute to read the grading rubric (https://goo.gl/CBEauz) and
the assignment specification (https://goo.gl/MWh5Sd). This is basically identical
to your previous assignment (with a few tweaks that make it more open-ended
and challenging).

Grading
You will be graded on the quality of your submission. We will use the rubric in
the previous step to evaluate your code. We have no tolerance for submissions
that attempt to ""game"" the system, e.g. by defining the datatype ""set"" in a
way to cause the grading script to pass trivially. The assignment is not an
easy A.

239,4.725426478020381,Write a function to calculate the factorial of a given number.,"Write a function to calculate the factorial of a given number. A factorial of a number measures the number of ways to arrange distinct objects in order (value of $n!) $=$ $n x (n - 1) x (n - 2)$ ... 1.

Example:
factorial(0) => 1
factorial(1) => 1
factorial(3) => 6

Recursive Procedure:

The idea for the procedure can be separated into two cases:

The base case, which sends back the value 1;
The recursive case, which makes the function call itself, but with a smaller argument.

```python
def factorial(n):
   if n==0:
       return 1
   else:
       return n*factorial(n-1)

factorial(5)   # 120
```

Avoid loops. No looping constructs may appear in your program anywhere, not even hidden inside other procedures you’ve written, because that would prevent you from solving this problem using recursion.

529,10.262360295979306,"Given a sequence of matrices, find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices.","Given a sequence of matrices, find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices. This problem as an interview question can be asked in club events or in top tech companies in campus placements.

Mathematically, multiplying two matrices Matrix A of size m x n and Matrix B of size p x q, results into a Matrix of size m x q if n = p or an error of invalid operation otherwise.

Let’s say we have three matrices of dimensions 100×200, 200×300, 300×400. But it will not be a practical way to multiply them in the same order. Instead, first, we will multiply the first and second matrices to give a result(Matrix) of size 100×300. Now, we multiply this result with the third matrix.

Example:
Input: matrices =[[5,10],
                 [2,3],
                 [2,3]]
Output: 18000

Explanation: Initially, we multiply matrix of size 5×10 with matrix of size 10×20. The resultant matrix will be of size 5×20 and requires 500 multiplications.
Next we will multiply the resultant matrix with the third matrix of size 20×30. The resultant matrix will be of size 5×30 and requires 1500 multiplications. 
So the total number of multiplications are 1500+500=2000.

Notes:
There are O(N^3) solutions.

The path is of the form P = (v, w_0(v,w), w_1(v,w), ..., w_n,k(v,w)). The time complexity of this algorithm is O(|E|*lg|V|) where |E| and |V| denote the number of edges and vertices in the graph, respectively. A weighted graph may have negative edge weights. Negative cycle detection is known to be a lot harder than the standard problem so we will consider all instances violating the negative cycle assumption as ""not different"" from instances of Dijkstra's algorithm 
! Input
The graph G has a number of vertices, V ≥ 1, and a number of edges, E ≥ 0. All nodes are labeled with integers, 0 ≤ w_v, w_w ≤ 1000 here 0 ≤ w_v, w_w ≤ K where K is a parameter of the problem. All edge indicators are also integers, 0 ≤ w_v, w_w ≤ K. Now there are two edges with ten indicators, v and w. On these edges, there is no negative cycle in G.
Output
The first line must contain the minimum path length to the output L. Each of the next L lines must describe one edge of the path P.
