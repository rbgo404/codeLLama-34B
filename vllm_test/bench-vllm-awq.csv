Example:

Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101] , therefore the length is 4. 

Note:
There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.
Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?


Solution:
1. DP
这题一看就很像 DP，因为这里我们求的就是从 i 结尾的最长递增子序列的长度。直接定义一个DP数组 dp[i] 表示以 i 结尾的最长递增子序列的长度，那么如果我们求出了 dp[i] 都等于多少，那么我们只需要求相应的最大值就可以了。

状态转移方程就是
dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[m] + 1), m < i and nums[m] < nums[i]
这里 m 的取值就是 nums[m] < nums[i] 中的最大值

状态转移方程也可以改成
dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1), 0 < j < i and nums[j] < nums[i]


2. Binary Search


下面解法中, 初始化 dp[i] = idx[nums[i]] + 1，其中 idx[nums[i]] 代表 nums[i] 所在的数组中的下标，idx 的定义为 idx[nums[i]] = i，idx[nums[i-1]] = i，只要当前 nums[i] 的值比之前的 nums[i-1] 的值大，则 idx 数组就会再"

"Given a weighted graph and two vertices, find the shortest path between them using Dijkstra's algorithm.",vLLM,512,13.745715881988872,"

This time, though, I'd like to somehow be able to keep track of how many nodes the program has visited before finding the shortest path.

I have implemented dijkstra's algorithm, the resulting shortest path is in order from the edges with the smallest weight, but now I'd like to maintain an order.  So if vertex A is connected to C with a weight of 0.5, B connects to C with a weight of 10, A connects to B with a weight of 4, A connect to E with a weight or 1, and E connects to B with a weight of 2, the path would be A, E, B, C (a weight of 3.5).  Now I'd like to keep track of how many vertices it visited before getting to that path.  In terms of the alphabet, it would have to visit 4 vertices before finding the shortest path unlike BFS, A*, etc. where we can somehow keep track of how many vertices it has visited.

Thus to conclude, I'm trying to find how many vertices we've visited \strong{before getting the shortest path.}
