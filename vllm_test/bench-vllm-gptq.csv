Write a function to determine if a given string is a palindrome.,vLLM,512,8.53040902101202," 
A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

## 1. Explain why you might want a function like this
palindromes is something interesting string and something i have worked on it before and i like challenging myself by adding more and more features.

## 2. Suggest names you would use for the function if you were designing it in a different programming language (ask your neighbor if you don't know a nice programming language that has good support for designing functions)

i am using palindrome is it 


## 3. Explain what parameters your function will take (if any) and what the return type is (or void if nothing is returned)


you will take a string of a words and the code will return boolean type.

  ## 4. Demonstrate in code how your function interacts with the rest of the code

"Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.",vLLM,245,4.085563760017976,"

For example,
Given [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18],
The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], therefore the length is 4. Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.

Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.

Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity? 
```
class Solution:
    # @param num, a list of integer
    # @return an integer
    def longestIncreasingSubsequence(self, num):

"Given a sequence of matrices, find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices.",vLLM,106,1.7975359160045628," In other words, determine where to place parentheses to minimize the number of multiplications.

For example, suppose we have four matrices A, B, C, and D. The goal is to find where to place parentheses to minimize the number of multiplications.

Note: A multiplication between two matrices can be performed in O(n^2) time.

"Given a weighted graph and two vertices, find the shortest path between them using Dijkstra's algorithm.",vLLM,144,2.4524014049966354,"
The first line of input contains the number of test cases.
For each test case, the first line of input is the number of edges in the graph.
This is followed by a line for each edge that contains the starting and ending vertices and the edge weight.
The edges are numbered from 1 to n with vertex numbering starting at 1.
Take care to mind these values as you implement your solution.
Finally, the last and third-to-last lines of each test case contain the starting and ending vertex numbers, respectively, for the shortest path query.
