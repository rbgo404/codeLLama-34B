Write a function to calculate the factorial of a given number.,vLLM,512,8.54039600098622,"
Factorial of a positive integer, is the multiplication of all the integers till the number.
Note: Factorials for negative numbers do not exist.
In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n represents the product of all positive integers from 1 to n. In terms of the gamma function, it is written as n! = Γ(n + 1).
The factorial of one or any positive integer is the simplest expression by using product notation for a multiple number of items.
For example 5! = 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 120.
Once the maximum value exceeds the environment's largest integer, results of factorial e.g. eleven plus one, would become very large numbers. Maybe with more than one hundred digits.
5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5,040, 8! = 40,320, 9! = 362,880, 10! = 3,628,800, 11! = 39,916,800, 12! = 479,001,600.
To prevent warnings from using an integer literal as the exponent in operation projects related to mixed number, int must be width-explicit. Implicit integer promotion happens only with integer literals. The use of the -fsanitize=cast sanitizer expands to -fno-sanitize=cast and -fno-sanitize=bounds. The use of the -fsanitize=bounds sanitizer expands to -fsanitize=bounds-strict and -fsanitize=bounds-legacy.
10 is not a string and so it is confused by // operator and generates a warning. Can we change it to be a string? Use constructor syntax.
To return the average we'll need to adjust this function return type to a double. Finally, use a type template parameter for T and specialize the template for it to be of type int designating other types of numerical literals.

For example,
Given [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18],
The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], therefore the length is 4. Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.

Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.

Answer: Your algorithm runs in O(n^2) time, but it's better, if you accept help from someone else. Let's look at what you can to improve:

Take a closer look at a solution that uses DP. There are two things that lead your solution most probably to exponential time:

\item In each step, you go through a previous big subsequence, and add +1 to combinations. That's what the flaw is. Even if you replaced it with best possible solution, you still have a big quadratic complexity. Take a"

"Given a weighted graph and two vertices, find the shortest path between them using Dijkstra's algorithm.",vLLM,512,8.62068379597622,"

## Algorithm

Given a weighted graph $G = (V, E)$ and two vertices $u, v \in V$, the algorithm to locate the shortest
path from $u$ to $v$ is shown below:

1. Create a priority queue $Q$ of pairs $(d_v, v)$ initialized with $Q = \{(d(u, v), v)\}$ (zero if $u = v$)
2. Initialize a mapping $P$ from vertices to edges or prior vertices in the path: $P[v] = \text{null}$
3. Pop the minimum $(d, v)$ pair $d$ and $v$ from $Q$
    1. If $v = v$ return the shortest path from $u$ to $v$, reconstructing via $P$
    2. If an entry $(d, v)$ with key $v$ exists in $Q$, remove it from $Q$
4. For each outgoing edge $e = (v, w)$ with weight $w(e)$, with $v = v$, check if adding $w(e)$ to $d$ would decrease
   the cost to $w$:
   1. If so:
      1. Increase $d$ by $w(e)$
      2. Set $p_v = v$, $p_w = v$
      3. Add $(d, w)$ to $Q$
   2. Otherwise take no action
      
The above algorithm takes as input a graph $G = (V, E)$ and the path and cost mappings:
<div style=""direction:ltr"">

$$
P = \left\{
  w : V \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}
\right\}\\
d = \left\{
  e : P \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}
\right\}
$$

</div>


So to start, we first populate the priority queue and initial path and cost mappings like the following;

1. Initialize with the predecessor of $u$ being $u$ itself and with its distance being zero.
