JavaScript's built-in regular expression engine mixed with Arrow Functions make simple String transformations a lot of fun.
Given an integer, return a string containing the word THAT and every digit of the integer, except the digit at position 3.
These substitutes don't need to be in uppercase characters, but you should keep the THAT all uppercase.
Examples
that(45678) ➞ ""THAT 4568""

that(555555) ➞ ""THAT 55555""
thats(23) ➞ ""THATS 2""
Notes
For replacing multiple characters, use RegExp and template literals in the callback of replace.
We're open to seeing design patterns other than .replace() too.

Write a function to determine if a given string is a palindrome.,vLLM,240,11.159370526002022," A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward as backward.

1. Determine if the: string is one of the 4 interactions allowed with strings - ""strin"", ""TrStR"" with ""deed"", ""main/stain"", ""Madam I’m Adam"" are good.

2. If it is, call the reverse_str function developed in questions 12-13 of last time to fix the string and send it into Q1, matching palindromes.

3. Double check if palindromes is in word_list.txt, if it is, add them to a list called with_palindromes.

4. Remember to call your current lists of answers - withour_palindromes, with_palindromes, answers and global palindromes_set, then update the other two in the reverse.

Output:
Check if given strings are palindromes and if a palindrome is also a word; print [palindrome] or [not a palindrome] for each input.

"Given a sequence of matrices, find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices.",vLLM,512,23.944177527999273," In other words, determine where to position parentheses so that the cost of multiplying the matrices is minimized.
Note: You can assume that the input is well formed.
For example, if you are given the following sequence of matrices:
A0 × A1 × A2 × A3

You can write the above product as
( (A0 × A1) × (A2 × A3) )

Or you can write it as
( (A0 × A1) × (A2 × A3) )

Or you can write it as
( A0 × (A1 × (A2 × A3) ) )

Each of these parentheses placements can be evaluated to provide a cost as follows:

((A0 × A1) × (A2 × A3)) = (2 x 3) x (3 x 4) = 24
((A0 × A1) × (A2 × A3)) = ((2 x 3) × 3) × 4 = 28
(A0 × (A1 × (A2 × A3))) = (2 × (3 × (3 × 4))) = 48
You should return 28, as it is the smallest of the three costs.

"Given a binary search tree, write a function to find the Kth smallest element.",vLLM,283,13.188542687974405,"
Define k as smallest.
not sure why root.left is everything smaller than the root. How is the root the largest element? I'm not a CS student, but from my understanding of BSTs, the root is the median and each child is either everything smaller than root or everything larger than root.
If you are iterating through the inorder traversal of the subtree with root Node (also a BST), how can left (or right) contain any elements greater or lesser than root?
It must always be the left of tree which is smaller since it is a BST i.e. left <= root <= right.
so root.left will always be smaller than root? even when the left is a subtree of elements greater than the root?
so it's literally finding the kth largest element then in every branch of the tree, unless i'm missing something else? I'm trying to grasp this.
There is no question about left.left / left.right here, because every node you visit is a root of a subtree.
""How is this still counting towards K?""
That's the recursive call. Each time you enter the second line (i.e. the first line of count function), the root on that level becomes the max_ with k decremented by 1."
"Given a weighted graph and two vertices, find the shortest path between them using Dijkstra's algorithm.",vLLM,512,23.969532226008596,"
Input Specification :
Line 1 : Two numbers (i.e. the first and last vertices)
Line 2 : The maximum number of vertices present in the graph (i.e. Vmax)
Line 3 : The first vertex from the first path
Line 4: The second vertex from the first path, first weight.
Line 5: The second vertex from the first path, second weight.
Line 6: The second vertex from the first path, third weight.
....
N lines : The second vertex from the Mth path, Mth weight.
Output Specification :
Print the distance of the shortest path in the first line.
Print the vertices of the path in the second line.
The vertices should be printed with an space in between them and should be arranged according to order of them in the path (like in the output given below).
