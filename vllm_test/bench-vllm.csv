Factorial holds value of product of all numbers from given number n till 1.

"Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.",vLLM,478,22.37170313700335,"

For example,
Given [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18],
The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], therefore the length is 4. Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.

Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.

Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?

"Given a sequence of matrices, find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices.",vLLM,481,22.520687391981483," The problem is not actually to perform the multiplications, but merely to decide in which order to perform the multiplications.

For example, suppose the sequence is A,B,C,D,E, where A is a 10x30 matrix, B is a 30x5 matrix, C is a 5x60 matrix, and so forth. We could naively do the whole thing as (AB)(C)(DE). However, a better ordering would be (E)(DE)(C)(B)(A), a matrix chain for which the actual number of floating point operations (flops) involved is only 30x30x60 + 30x5x30 + 10x30x5 + 5x60x10 =21600 + 4500 + 1500 + 600 = 27100 flops, rather than 10x30x5 + 30x5x60 + 5x60x10 + 10x30x60 = 45000 flops.

The goal of the computation is to calculate matrices representing the cost of multiplying a given pair of matrices. Thus, the algorithm i should produce as output the cost table 

     0 10'00000 5'26000 7'54000
     1 0 8'90000 7'74000 13'15000
     2 0 3'13000 3'83000 9'04000
     3 0 4'11000 4'91000 13'90000
     4 0 0 5'31000 10'64000

which means that the cost matrix associated with the given matrices would be such that “subi-j” gives the cost of computing A sub i × A_sub j. Here, ' indicates multiplication, and ” indicates addition.
