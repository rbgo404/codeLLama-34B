"Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.",vLLM,398,10.623042316990905,"

Example:

Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 

Note:
There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.

Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?

"Given a sequence of matrices, find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices.",vLLM,512,13.705516941001406," [...]

Assume:
\begin{itemize}
\item All matrices are square.
\item Matrices are of type AxB means Bx1 matrix can be multiplied with AxB matrix (think of height*width of the pixels in a video resolution of 960*720).
\end{itemize}

In other words, to find the most efficient way to multiply a chain of matrices, we order the matrices and then multiply them one by one.

For example:

chain: BxA CxB DxC ExD -> most efficient arrangement is (BxA)^{0} (CxB)^{1} (DxC)^{2} (ExD)^{3}
chain: BxA CxB DxC AxD -> most efficient arrangement is (BxA)^{1} (CxB)^{2} (DxC)^{3} (AxD)^{0}

The most efficient way to multiply a chain of matrices might not be one of permutations of the chain. So that's why I'm asking this question. It's from [Stanford Open class](https://class.stanford.edu/MainCards.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1). Below you'll see the hints, but please try it for yourself first.

The following three problems are from [Stanford Prob-Log class](http://pl-edx.stanford.edu). If you use the answers, then you can use them only in this homework. The aim of this assignment is to try out some smarter way of finding the point 'r' than simply comparing 1000 of random points. You can of course write a script that would do it for you, but remember that it should take much less time than 1 second.

Two discovers have found traces of intelligent life on a distant planet. [Problem 1](http://pl-edx.stanford.edu/img/hw1/problem1.pdf) - A and B represent their hypotheses about where the life might be. At the top right matrix you can see their common background of knowledge. Idea of this problem is to find least error valid hypothesis. In other words, you should find a point, where optimal given probabilities of surviving combinations. In other words, the point"
"Given a binary search tree, write a function to find the Kth smallest element.",vLLM,223,5.935022137971828,"

Specifically, the function accepts the root of the BST and a value K as inputs, and returns the Kth smallest value.

It is guaranteed that the tree has at least K nodes.

You may assume that all elements in the BST are distinct.

 

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], K = 1
   3
  / \
 1   4
  \
   2
Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], K = 3
       5
      / \
     3   6
    / \
   2   4
  /   
 1
Output: 3

Follow up:
What if the BST is modified (insert / delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?"

    Calculate shortest path lengths from start

    Args:
        start: the node to start from
        graph:

    Returns:
        Array of distances from start to each node

    Theory:
        Create a priority queue ordered by distances and choose the lowest.
        For each item in the priority queue:
            Calculate edges from the current node, DECREASING BY SETTING MAXIMUMS.
            This will cut off paths that can't possibly beat the existing distance.
            For example, if you've already found a distance of 4 for one node, don't
            bother considering paths that will start or end at that node with a larger
            weight.
            For each edge:
                Calculate path length for this edge
                The path is start to end and new nodes are ones that are present in this edge
                (we've undirected the edge).
                Initialize the path length for the new node by adding the calculated edge path length.
                Based on the previously undirected edge, set the maximum weight for the existing
                node. The max weight needs to be lower to represent the highest better path.
                For example, if this edge was 3 (1->2) but the path of 3 through nodes 3 to
                this point is 6 (1->2->3->4), this new path is better and the maximum value for
                node 4 needs to be lower to represent that better path.
            After calculating all edge weights, add the path weights to the priority queue.

    Examples:
    >>> shortest_path_lengths(0, {0:[(1"
